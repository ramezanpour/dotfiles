# My \*NIX shell configuration (dotfiles)

My dotfiles is one of the simple ones. It contains configuration files for the apps I use the most in the terminal (and the terminal itself). The following is what you can find here:

- ZSH configuration for [OH-MY-ZSH](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
- tmux <https://github.com/tmux/tmux>
- iTerm2 <https://iterm2.com/>
- Neovim (I recently moved to neovim from vim)
- Vim (Although I have moved to neovim but I still try to keep my vim configs up-to-date)
- Newsboat as RSS reader <https://github.com/newsboat/newsboat>
